## Evaluation
This phase evaluate the results of your efforts using the business success criteria established at the beginning of the project. This is the key to ensuring that your organization can make use of the results you've obtained. Two types of results are produced by data mining:

The final models selected in the previous phase of CRISP-DM.
Any conclusions or inferences drawn from the models themselves as well as from the data mining process. These are known as findings.

### - Evaluating the Results ###

> At this stage, you formalize your assessment of whether or not the project results meet the business success criteria. This step requires a clear understanding of the stated business goals, so be sure to include key decision makers in the project assessment.

1) First, you need to document your assessment of whether the data mining results meet the business success criteria. Consider the following questions in your report:
 - Are your results stated clearly and in a form that can be easily presented?
 - Are there particularly novel or unique findings that should be highlighted?
 - Can you rank the models and findings in order of their applicability to the business goals?
 - In general, how well do these results answer your organization's business goals?
 - What additional questions have your results raised? How might you phrase these questions in business terms?
2) After you have evaluated the results, compile a list of approved models for inclusion in the final report. This list should include models that satisfy both the data mining and business goals of your organization.


### - Review Process ###
> Effective methodologies usually include time for reflection on the successes and weaknesses of the process just completed. Data mining is no different. Part of CRISP-DM is learning from your experience so that future data mining projects will be more effective.

> First, you should summarize the activities and decisions for each phase, including data preparation steps, model building, etc. Then for each phase, consider the following questions and make suggestions for improvement:

 - Did this stage contribute to the value of the final results?
 - Are there ways to streamline or improve this particular stage or operation?
 - What were the failures or mistakes of this phase? How can they be avoided next time?
 - Were there dead ends, such as particular models that proved fruitless? Are there ways to predict such dead ends so that efforts can be directed more productively?
 - Were there any surprises (both good and bad) during this phase? In hindsight, is there an obvious way to predict such occurences?
 - Are there alternative decisions or strategies that might have been used in a given phase? Note such alternatives for future data mining projects.

### - Determining the Next Steps ###
> By now, you've produced results, evaluated your data mining experiences, and may be wondering, Where to next? This phase helps you to answer that question in light of your business goals for data mining. Essentially, you have two choices at this point:

1) Continue to the deployment phase. The next phase will help you to incorporate the model results into your business process and produce a final report. Even if your data mining efforts were unsuccessful, you should use the deployment phase of CRISP-DM to create a final report for distribution to the project sponsor.
2) Go back and refine or replace your models. If you find that your results are almost, but not quite, optimal, consider another round of modeling. You can take what you've learned in this phase and use it to refine the models and produce better results.

> Your decision at this point involves the accuracy and relevancy of the modeling results. If the results address your data mining and business goals, then you are ready for the deployment phase. Whatever decision you make, be sure to document the evaluation process thoroughly.
